This is a mock social media site that allows users to make posts with an option to add tags. The most used tags on the site are listed in the sidebar on the right.

The site uses MongoDB to perform full CRUD operations on posts. Users can edit and delete existing posts directly from the post itself, and update both the UI and the backend database.

I used Material UI for easy styling. https://mui.com/material-ui/
